Create a database called 'my_first_db'.

use my_first_db

Create students collection.

db.createCollection("students")

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: {name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}}.

Create 5 students with the appropriate info.

Insert the 5 students into the students collection.

db.students.insert({name: "John", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 7, day: 7, year: 1977}})

db.students.insert({name: "Jane", home_state: "NY", lucky_number: 8, birthday: {month: 8, day: 8, year: 1988}})

db.students.insert({name: "Jack", home_state: "TX", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 9, day: 9, year: 1999}})

db.students.insert({name: "Jill", home_state: "FL", lucky_number: 10, birthday: {month: 10, day: 10, year: 2000}})

db.students.insert({name: "Joe", home_state: "WA", lucky_number: 11, birthday: {month: 11, day: 11, year: 2011}})

Get all students.

db.students.find()

db.students.find({$or: [{home_state: "CA"}, {home_state: "WA"}]})

Get all students whose lucky number is:

greater than 5

db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}})

less than or equal to 10

db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

between 1 and 9 (inclusive)

db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 1, $lte: 9}})

Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.

db.students.update({}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}}, {multi: true})

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.

db.students.update({name: "John"}, {$push: {interests: "reading"}})

db.students.update({name: "Jane"}, {$push: {interests: "writing"}})

db.students.update({name: "Jack"}, {$push: {interests: "drawing"}})

db.students.update({name: "Jill"}, {$push: {interests: "painting"}})

db.students.update({name: "Joe"}, {$push: {interests: "singing"}})

Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.

db.students.update({name: "John"}, {$push: {interests: "taxes"}})

Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.

db.students.update({name: "John"}, {$pull: {interests: "taxes"}})

Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).

db.students.remove({$or: [{home_state: "CA"}, {home_state: "WA"}]})

Remove a student by name.

db.students.remove({name: "John"})

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)

db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.

db.students.update({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}}, {multi: true})

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

db.students.update({home_state: "WA"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1}}, {multi: true})

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'

db.students.update({}, {$rename: {number_of_belts: "belts_earned"}}, {multi: true})

Remove the 'lucky_number' field.

db.students.update({}, {$unset: {lucky_number: ""}}, {multi: true})
